Feature: Event organizer
  Logged in users can create a new event, list all events, query the specific event by guid of the event and modify the selected event  

Background: 
  Given caller presents a valid access token
   And the endpoint of the events controller "api/v1/organizer/events" is exist
   
Scenario: Jhond user post a valid event without a capacity to the endpoint
  Given "koncert1" event doesn't exist in the database
  When I post a new event to the endpoint
   And I type "Budapest" in the location field
   And I type "Magyarorszag" in the country field
   And I type "koncert1" in the name field
   But I shouldn't type id or creation date of the event
  Then I should have seen HTTP status is "200"
   And the certain event is created in the database with an unique id of the event and creation time of the event
   
Scenario: Alice user post a valid event with a capacity to the endpoint
  Given "koncert2" event doesn't exist in the database
  When I post a new event to the endpoint
   And I type "Budapest" in the location field
   And I type "Magyarorszag" in the country field
   And I type "koncert2" in the name field
   And I type "100" in the capacity field
   But I shouldn't type id or creation date of the event 
  Then I should have seen HTTP status is "200"
   And the certain event is created in the database with an unique id of the event and creation time of the event
   
Scenario: Jhond user post a valid event without a country to the endpoint
  Given "koncert3" event doesn't exist in the database
  When I post a new event to the endpoint
   And I type "Budapest" in the location field
   And I type "koncert3" in the name field
   And I type "100" in the capacity field
   But I shouldn't type id or creation date of the event 
  Then I should have seen HTTP status is "200"
